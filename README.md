# TransTraffic: Predicting Network Traffic using Low Resource Data**

In private 5G/6G networks, an adequate and accurate resource management is essential. We propose a traffic prediction model, TransTraffic, that utilizes transfer learning for low resource data. Our evaluation demonstrates that leveraging prior knowledge from a similar traffic domain helps predict network traffic for a new domain or service.

This codebase contains the python scripts for the model for the ICTC 2022.  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9952575/

## Data

To learn the proposed model, we utilize an open source *[traffic prediction dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128620312081).*

The dataset consists of network packets, collected from February 20th to October 6th in 2019, with the following components: the timestamp of the packet, protocol, the size of the payload, source/destination IP address, source/destination UDP/TCP port, and the types of the user activity (i.e., Interactive, Bulk, Video, and Web). The four types of user activity are summarized as follows.

- *Interactive*: Interactive activity includes traffic from real time interactive applications such as chatting app or remote file editing in Google Docs.
- *Bulk*: Bulk data transfer activity consists of traffic to applications that use significant portions of the networkâ€™s bandwidth for large data file transfers, e.g., large file downloads from Dropbox.
- *Video*: Video playback activity includes traffic from applications consuming videos (e.g., from Twitch or YouTube).
- *Web*: Web browsing consists of traffic for all activities within a web page such as downloading images or ads.

Our model outperforms both MLP and LSTM models in three different user activity data (i.e., *Bulk*, *Video*, and *Web*). In particular, compared to other baselines, the proposed model shows relatively good performance even with the extremely small amount of data (i.e., *Video* and *Web*).

To explore the effectiveness of the transfer learning, we compare the traffic prediction performance of the proposed model between with and without transfer learning.
